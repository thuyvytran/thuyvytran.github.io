## June 28 to July 2 ##

### June 28 2021 ###
I started writing the background section since Friday. I read a lot of psychology papers to try to explain the human feedback. I decided to do two paragraphs dedicated to how work fatigue can effect concentration.

### June 29 2021 ###

I had a meeting with my mentor about my progress with the background section of my paper. The main problem with my background was focusing too much on the psychology of fatigue and how it effect work. when I needed to explain how fatigue effects how a human teaches a robot. The one thing I learned was it is important to connect the background to my research. The background section is supposed to be the reason why someone would want to read my research.

### June 30 - July 2 ###
After my mentor helped me revise my background section. I decided to read more papers about reinforcement learning. Then I worked on each specifc pargraph making sure it connected with my research.
