## Week 3 ##
### June 14 2021 ###

Today I finished going through and checking one of the graduate student's papers before submission. I learned a lot about the formatting of what a research paper should entail. Also, what techniques and how they use LaTex to their advantage.

I meet up with Dr.Short to ask for guidance on writing the introduction section of my paper. I've been stuck for a week, not knowing what to write in the introduction section. She told me the main point of the introduction is to summarize the research. The main goal is to explain why your topic of research is crucial to your field. 

My other question was, how do you know which paper would help strengthen the thesis. Since there are so many papers, it's almost impossible to use them all in the research.  My mentor advised me to look at research and look at their references. By looking at the reference, I can get more information about the topic.

I decided to help out with a different graduate student with their research to gain more experience. I was giving my first python coding project, which was to take three parameters from the commandline arguement as an integer. But also to use the main function to implement it. It took me a while to figure out. But the lesson I learned was to take breaks when you are stuck.
