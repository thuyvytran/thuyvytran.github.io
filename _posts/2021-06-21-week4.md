## June 21 to June 25 ##
### June 21 2021 ###
I am still writing the introdiction section as anticpiated. The part I am currently struggling is comning up with good examples that help strengthen my research. 
I learned that when writing an introduction section it is a short outline of what the paper is about. In the section it will talk about the introduction, background, methodology, discussion and conclusion. Since most people only read the introduction when reading the paper.

I went over with my mentor of what the background section should be abolut. The background section is supposed to give the details about what type of topics my paper will be about. Also, it ties in with what my research is about and why it is so important. 
### June 24 to 25 2021 ###
I read more papers to get a better understanding of my topic of the introduction paragraph. I have over 80% of the introduction section finished. I wil be starting my background section very soon.
