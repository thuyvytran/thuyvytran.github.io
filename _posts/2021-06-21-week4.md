## Week 4 ##
### June 21 2021 ###
I am still writing the introdiction section as anticpiated. The part I am currently struggling is comning up with good examples that help strengthen my research. 


### June 22 2021 ###
Went over my background section for the research.

### June 24 to 25 2021 ###
I read more papers to get a better understanding of my topic of the introduction paragraph. I have over 80% of the introduction section finished.
