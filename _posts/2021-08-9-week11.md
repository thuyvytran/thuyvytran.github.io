I vistied the Tufts University Robotics Lab. To check out the robots at the lab. Also, I took a look at the robotic arm in the lab that is being used by Issac. I also did a test drive of playing around with the robots they had on campus. 

### August 11 to August 13 2021 ###
I started working on getting familiar with [OpenGym AI](https://gym.openai.com/) to use to test my algorithm out. I had diffculty trying to use it in jupyter notebook at first because the documentation wasn't written well. Instead I have found this [pdf](http://acme.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/OpenGym19.pdf) to be helpful in helping me understand OpenGym AI. I finished with writing the methodology and most of the user study.
