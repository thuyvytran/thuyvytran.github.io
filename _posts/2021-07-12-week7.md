## July 12 ##

I was debating wheter or not what frameworks should I use to help anyalize the effect of duration has on human feedback. I looked at both TAMERs and Policy Shaping framework to get a better idea of what I want to do with my project. The two frameworks are common to use for robotics and HRI, so I thought it would be the best would to read more papers to compare the two.

To add a bit more information about each framework down below.
#### TAMERS Framework ####
* It's a framework that looks at human feedback and uses it to help maximize the reward the robot gets from their given action.
* It allows for anyone to give feedback to robots because no technical skill is needed to give feedback.
* I can use the framework to look at the human side of feedback and see how it affects the robot learning.

#### Policy-Shaping Framework ####
* This framework allows robot to compelete tasks while the human feedback are taking a break or not in the area.
* The robots learn from their environment instead of the human teacher. 
* If I gave the particpants break I could use this feedback to keep analyzing the robot feedback.

Talked with my mentor disscussing what would be the best two framework to test out my theory. She suggested that I should try to implement both TAMERs and Policy framework into my reserach. 

## July 14 - July 15 ##

I read a couple of papers looking at their methodology section to have a good idea on how to write it. I also looked a little bit into a book about research in human and robotic interaction

## July 16 ##
I spent the day practicing my programming skills in python to better prepare for the algorithm section.
