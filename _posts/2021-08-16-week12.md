## August 16 to August 23 ##


### August 16 2021 ###
I did more editing and research into openGym AI. I was still feeling a bit stuck on the questionnare for the user study because I wanted to use questions from previous study to make my life easier. 

### August 17 2021 ###
I talked to my mentor before I left and she says to just finish editing the introduction, methodology, user study and background before I finish my internship. 
### August 18 to August 23 2021 ###
I was working on the last part of editing before heading home on saturday. I finish this blog on Monday August 23! I hope you enjoyed seeing my journey as a research intern.
